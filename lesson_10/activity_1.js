// Introduction to JavaScript by Mark Winteringham
// Lesson 10 - Activity 1 - Loops

// Below are a series of incomplete loops. Complete them so that they output
// the expected data stated in the loop challenge.

// Challenge 1 - Incrementing loop
// Currently this loop doesn't run at all. Update the loop so that it counts up
// from 0 all the way to 10:

for(i = 1; i < 0; i){
    console.log('Challenge 1 count: ' + i);
}

// Challenge 2 - Decreasing loop
// Currently this loop doesn't run at all. Update the loop so that it counts down
// from 10 down to 1:

for(i = 1; i == 0; i){
    console.log('Challenge 2 count: ' + i);
}

// Challenge 3 - Build a for loop from scratch
// Create a for loop that starts at five and counts up to 15:

console.log('Challenge 3 - Incomplete');

// Challenge 4 - Loop through staff names
// Create a for loop that loops through each of the staff names in the array
// below. TIP: You will need to research how to get the numerical size of the
// array. 

let staff = ['Bernard', 'Manny', 'Fran'];

for(i = 1; i < 0; i){
    console.log('Challenge 2 count: ' + i);
}

// Challenge 5 - Loop through staff names again
// Create a loop that loops through each of the staff names. This time
// using a for / in loop instead of a standard for loop (Feel free to Google it)

console.log('Challenge 5 - Incomplete');

// Challenge 6 - Incrementing while loop
// Using a while loop and an if statement

console.log('Challenge 6 - Incomplete');

// Challenge 7 - Break a loop
// Using a for loop, an if statement and the keyword break (Google it). Have a loop
// count up to to 10 but break the loop early when the count reaches 5

console.log('Challenge 7 - Incomplete');
